// Description: A console application that asks if it should role 2 dice.
// After receiving a positive answer a random number method will display
// 2 numbers and then it will ask if you want it to do it again. 
// I declare that the following source code was written solely by me.
// I understand that copying any source code, in whole or in part, 
// constitutes cheating, and that I will receive a zero on this project
// if I am found in violation of this policy.

            //Use writeline to ask if the user wants to roll the dice.
            //Use a readline to get the response.
            //Use a do method to keep the responses to a yes or no answer.
            //If the answer isn't yes or no use writeline to tell them that the answer isn't valid.
            //Use the parameters while(answer != yes || no)


            //If the answer is yes then proceed with the program.
            //Use the "do" method to generate a loop.
            //Use two random dice methods to roll dice.
            //If they roll 2 6's use writeline to say boxcars!
            //If they roll 2 1's use writeline to say snake eyes!
            //If they roll something other than two 1's or 6's use writeline to tell them what they got.
            //Use writeling to ask them if they want to do it again.
            //Use readline to get a response.
            //While the response is yes then do it again.


            //If the answer is no then use writeline to tell them good bye and close the application.

            //If the answer isn't yes or no then use writeline to tell them that the answer isn't valid and try again.
            //Use the "while" end method to send them back to the top.

            //Use readline to keep the program open.
